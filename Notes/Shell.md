# Shell

## What is the shell?

The shell is basically a program that takes your commands from the keyboard and sends them to the operating system to perform

## Bash

- `echo`, `pwd`, `touch`, `cat`
- `cd`
	- `cd .` / `cd ..` / `cd ~`
	- `cd -` -> previous directory you were just at.
- `ls`
	- `ls -a` -> show hidden.
	- `ls -l` -> long info.
	- `ls -R` -> recursively list directory contents
	- `ls -r` -> reverse order while sorting
	- `ls -t` -> sort by modification time, newest first
- `file` -> to find out what kind of file a file is.

### Etc
- `nohup <cmd> &` -> detaches the process completely (daemonizes it)
