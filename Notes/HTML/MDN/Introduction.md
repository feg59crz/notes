# Introduction
## Element
[[Notes/HTML/MDN/HTML]] consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, wrap, or mark up different parts of content to make it appear or act in a certain way.

The anatomy of an element is:

- content
- closing tag
  
  

### Empty Elements

Single tag elements
